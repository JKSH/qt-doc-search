=============

A Google Chrome extension that provides streamlined documentation search for Qt developers.

The extension can be downloaded and installed from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qt-doc-search/gfigdpnkjnilcielpnmfmdnnbloabjoh

Note: The icons used in the actual extension are not part of this repository because I do not have the right to sublicense them.
